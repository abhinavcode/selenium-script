# Selenium Scripts

Selenium automates browsers. That's it! What you do with that power is entirely up to you. Primarily, it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that. Boring web-based administration tasks can (and should!) be automated as well.
Here is a python version of selenium binding to scrap.

## Requirements

  - Python
  - Chrome driver (or any other browsers driver). Download webdriver [here].

## Steps
Follow the following steps
- Install the dependency in python.
```sh
pip install selenium
```
- place chromedriver in the same folder as your code
- Run the code
- See the magic
